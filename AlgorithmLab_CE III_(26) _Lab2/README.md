Question No. 4

Insertion Sort
After the implementation of insertion sort and merge sort, I came to realize that Merge sorting is way more better than the Insertion sort. The time complexity of merge sort was very small while in the case of insertion sort the time complexity was high enough. This was also explained with the help of graph.

The average and worst time complexity of the insertion sort is O(n**2) while that of Merge sort is O(nlogn). Due to this fact, merge sort was way more faster than the insertion sort.

While the best time complexities of insertion sort and merge sort O(n) and O(nlogn). Due to this fact too, the insertion sort was more faster when it came to best case input. This may have possibly occur because while the data was sorted but the merge algorithm still applies dividing and conquering mechanism on the data.

The merge sort is comparatively better than insertion sort.
