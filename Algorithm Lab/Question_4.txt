The Linear and Binary Search was implemented on the programs Linear and Binary Search. I came to know that the Binary Search is very fast and effective compared to the linear search. The test cases were also built using the unittest module in python. The testcases were used to check the correctness of the algorithm. And, then the random module in the python was used to generate the Time plot for the Linear and Binary Search Algorithms.
